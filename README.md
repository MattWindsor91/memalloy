Quick start:

1. Modify `configure.sh` to suit your OS.

2. Run `source configure.sh`.

3. Run `make`.

4. Run `make models`.

5. Run `./compare.sh`. After a few minutes, this should create a file
   called `exec.png`, which is a picture of an execution that
   distinguishes two versions of the C11 memory model.
